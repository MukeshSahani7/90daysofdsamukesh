What is Time Complexity?
Time Complexity is the study of the efficiency of algorithms. It tells us how much time is taken by an algorithm 
to process a given input. Let's understand this concept with the help of an example:

What is a Big O?
Putting it simply, big O stands for ‘order of’ in our industry,
but this is pretty different from the mathematical definition of the big O. 
Big O in mathematics stands for all those complexities our program runs in. But in industry,
we are asked the minimum of them. So this was a subtle difference.
